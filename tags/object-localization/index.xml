      <description>In this post I will introduce the Object Localization and Detection task, starting from the most straightforward solutions, to the best models that reached state-of-the-art performances, i.e. R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN and YOLO.
Disclaimer: These notes are for the most part a collection of concepts taken from the slides of the &amp;lsquo;Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning&amp;rsquo; course at Polytechnic of Milan and from some other online resources. I am just putting together all the information to study for the exam and I thought it would be a good idea to upload them here since they can be useful for someone interested in this topic.</description>
