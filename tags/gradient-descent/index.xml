      <description>In this post we will talk about how error functions are used in Neural Networks and how they are selected according to the task we have to solve.
Disclaimer: These notes are for the most part a collection of concepts taken from the slides of the &amp;lsquo;Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning&amp;rsquo; course at Polytechnic of Milan and from some other online resources. I am simply putting together all the information to study for the exam and I thought it would be a good idea to upload them here since they can be useful for someone who is interested in this topic.</description>
