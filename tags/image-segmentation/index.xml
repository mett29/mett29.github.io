      <description>In this post I will explain Image Segmentation, focusing on the architecture of the models used to perform this task. Fully Convolutional Networks and U-Net will be at the center of the discussion.
Disclaimer: These notes are for the most part a collection of concepts taken from the slides of the &amp;lsquo;Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning&amp;rsquo; course at Polytechnic of Milan and from some other online resources. I am just putting together all the information to study for the exam and I thought it would be a good idea to upload them here since they can be useful for someone interested in this topic.</description>
