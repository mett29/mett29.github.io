      <description>In this post we will talk about the Bias-Variance tradeoff, explaining where it comes from and how we can manage it, introducing techniques for model selection (feature selection, regularization, dimensionality reduction) and model ensemble (bagging and boosting).
Disclaimer: the following notes were written following the slides provided by the professor Restelli at Polytechnic of Milan and the book &amp;lsquo;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&#39;.
Bias-Variance trade-off and Model Selection No Free Lunch Theorems Define $Acc_G(L)$ as the generalization accuracy of the learner $L$, which is the accuracy of $L$ on non-training samples.</description>
